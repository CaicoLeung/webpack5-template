                          Piers has worked for the past 18 years in Greek property and has been
                          responsible for some of the most significant deals in the Ionian. He has a
                          wealth of experience and knowledge in this market and uses this to great
                          effect when advising his clients. Piers first ventured onto the island of
                          Corfu at the age of 10 and has visited the island every year since, until
                          eventually relocating to Corfu in 2002.

                              His local knowledge and connections on the island were key in ensuring
                              that everything ran smoothly. Most importantly we have found Piers to be
                              an honest and trustworthy individual, who handled all matters on our
                              behalf with the utmost discretion. We know that if we ever wanted to
                              purchase a property on the island, he would be the best person to go to
                              for this very reason. The fact that his contacts and knowledge are
                              second to none is also a bonus.

                              Piers was recommended by a close friend as the person to help us find a
                              suitable seafront property in Corfu. He quickly grasped our brief,
                              understanding our key requirements.The service provided was very
                              personalized, confidential and discreet. We were impressed by his
                              ability to conduct meetings with us, either in Corfu or in London. Piers
                              was able to present to us several exclusive off market seafront
                              opportunities and it quickly became clear his knowledge of the area and
                              the market was second to none. He found us our ideal property,
                              negotiated the deal for us and held our hands throughout the entire
                              process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              After we acquired the property, Piers has been on hand to advise, acting
                              in a pivotal role in coordinating our project for renovating the villa
                              and enhancing the landscaping. He has also helped put key personnel in
                              place to aid with the day to day running of the property.It is clear to
                              us that Piers has excellent connections on the island and is well
                              respected amongst the local community.Piers has made the entire process
                              seamless and enjoyable.

                              business to anyone considering buying a property in Corfu.

                              I have spent several years looking into buying land and building in
                              North East Corfu and have now happily nearly finished our dream
                              project.There are many pitfalls in Corfu and the opportunities to fall
                              into them are numerous. But, the person who has been invaluable to me
                              and has helped me to arrive at the right destination is Piers Williams
                              from Ionian International, who knows the area extremely well.If you are
                              seriously looking at real estate in North East Corfu, he is totally
                              trustworthy, transparent and incredibly helpful. His knowledge of the
                              area, the people and the environment for a foreign buyer is unrivalled.
                              I would happily recommend him to anyone thinking of purchasing or
                              building on Corfu.

                              We most wholeheartedly commend and recommend Piers Williams, based upon
                              our association with him through a period of several years. He
                              represented us and acted as our real estate agent in connection with the
                              sale of property which we owned in Corfu, Greece. We found Piers to be
                              unusually dedicated and resourceful in effecting the sale of our
                              property.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              It was an extraordinarily difficult period in Greece, both economically
                              and in the real estate market. Piers was absolutely focused on finding a
                              buyer and seeing the deal through, despite many unexpected obstacles. We
                              encountered an unusual number of challenging difficulties during this
                              transaction and were particularly impressed by Piers' positive approach
                              to finding a solution at every juncture. If one strategy did not work,
                              he found another path to deal with the issue at hand. He dealt with
                              zoning issues; unexpected taxation and legal questions; governmental and
                              regulatory frustrations; and a variety of personalities with a
                              solution-oriented outlook, tact and diplomacy. We were struck by the
                              team he assembled, and his flexibility in organizing them to resolve
                              questions as they arose. We found him adept at dealing with local
                              problems and always finding a solution to whatever issue presented
                              itself. He was also at ease with dealing with people in all situations.
                              We felt we could rely upon him to fully represent us in every way. In
                              sum, we would recommend him most highly and unreservedly as a dedicated
                              and highly reliable and effective professional.

                              Piers was recommended to us by varying local sources on the island as
                              the best person to help us find a seafront villa. We found Piers to be
                              most knowledgeable about the market and the manner in which he operated
                              was very professional and tailored to our needs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Piers is incredibly well connected on the island and he used these
                              connections to find us a truly unique waterfront property. Throughout
                              the viewings and acquisition, Piers was on hand to guide us through the
                              process, and we found his ability to meet with us either in Corfu or
                              London really helpful. Piers then generated the idea of acquiring the
                              neighbouring property and successfully negotiated an off-market
                              acquisition of this villa and land.<br />
                              Piers introduced us to key personnel such as our lawyer and our builder
                              and he continues to be on hand to offer advice and help where needed. He
                              was instrumental in creating and orchestrating a clever planning concept
                              which enabled us to create much more living space.

                              I first met Piers Williams in April 2006 when I arranged to view a
                              property in Corfu, at very short notice, on Easter Saturday.
                              Notwithstanding the difficult timing, he took a great deal of trouble to
                              show us several properties up and down the North East and we made an
                              offer the same day on the property which we had originally come to view.
                              The transaction was very protracted owing to the size of the property,
                              the complex title and various other factors to do with the owner. During
                              all this time, Piers very patiently worked to disentangle the various
                              impediments, negotiated with both the elderly owner and her lawyer, and
                              gradually cleared the way to completion. This included arranging the
                              removals for the vendor.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Since that time, Piers has kept in touch offering us opportunities for
                              further investment on the Island as well as offering advice on strategy
                              for the development of our properties. Specifically, he recommended an
                              agent who negotiated the sale of our Athens flat in short order and on
                              very good terms. He has demonstrated detailed knowledge of the property
                              market in Greece and a wide knowledge of the characters and processes
                              involved. In Greece, this requires the ability to work in a society
                              which is very closed, transactions are rarely straightforward, and in
                              which greater than usual political skill and patience is required. Piers
                              has managed to retain a reputation for probity and to remain on good
                              terms with everybody there.

                              My wife and I have known Piers for almost a decade now and he has on our
                              behalf sourced, negotiated and acquired many different plots of land to
                              help create a unique and private _location on top of a hill with
                              exceptional views. We have been looking for the “right” _location on the
                              island for 5 years. It was actually on the first day when we went out to
                              explore sites with Piers that we found “our” place. I guess that is what
                              made us stick to Piers ever since then.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Piers is very smart and operates in a discreet and professional manner.
                              He can read his clients very well, so there is nothing like a “one size
                              fits all” approach with him. What I always found most helpful,
                              especially on an island like Corfu, is that he has a very good rapport
                              with the local community which is absolutely key and helps sort out
                              problems should they arise - he is certainly semi-local. Unlike most
                              real estate agents, Piers is not purely transactional. He will stay
                              close to help and advise years after he sold you the plot or property -
                              and is always coming up with ideas on what could be done next.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              I am happily recommending Piers to my friends or anyone wishing to buy
                              land or property in North East Corfu.

                              I have known Piers Williams for the past 15 years and he has helped me
                              expertly with my various property projects in Paxos, Greece. I have
                              found Piers to be knowledgeable and experienced with luxury property
                              throughout the Ionian. He is trustworthy, professional and has an
                              excellent reputation. I would not hesitate in recommending him.

                              I have known Piers since 2002 whom we met in Corfu and we became
                              friends. In 2004 we decided to build a property in Corfu. Piers sourced
                              us 3 different but adjoining plots of land which we then bought. During
                              the acquisition process we granted Piers power of attorney to represent
                              us and to sign the contracts at the notary. We then employed him as our
                              Project Manager.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Over the years Piers has made some very good contacts on the Island of
                              Corfu from builders, solicitors, architects, bank managers - all of whom
                              hold him in high regard and he used these contacts to good effect in
                              order to oversee the construction of our property from start to finish.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              With the project of building our house I also gave Piers power of
                              attorney for my bank account and to get all the legal papers done
                              without us having to commute to the Island ourselves, which enabled him
                              to pay the constructors throughout the build and enabled him to get the
                              services connected ie water, electricity, telephone lines etc etc. So we
                              had complete faith in him.&nbsp;Everything that we asked Piers to do -he
                              did - and the build came in on time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Further to this I am aware of numerous other projects and contracts that
                              Piers has been involved with. In all of which he is held in high regard.

                              In 2002 we established “North East Corfu Real Estate”, which as the
                              name states, was area specific to the North East Coast of Corfu and
                              focused on luxury property.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              We were the only true property experts dedicated to this region and we
                              were fortuitous enough to sell some of the most prestigious properties
                              in the area, including some incredible sea front villas. In
                              combination with villa sales we also sold many exceptional plots of
                              land, a lot of which we went on to oversee for our clients by project
                              managing the entire build process.

                              As the business grew, we started taking on instructions throughout the
                              Ionian, which was when we changed our name to “Ionian International”.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                              Throughout we have prided ourselves in looking after our clients by
                              offering a unique and bespoke service.

                              In February 2020 we became the first new international franchisee for
                              Chestertons, signing up to create Chestertons Ionian. Chestertons
                              Ionian will operate across Corfu, Kefalonia, Paxos, Zakynthos, Lefkada

                      Lefkada is the only Ionian island connected to the mainland via a causeway.
                      There are 24 tiny islands in and around Lefkada and the island itself has many
                      natural inlets and an international marina making it an ideal destination for
                      sailing. The west coast boasts long sandy beaches and stunning scenery. This
                      laid back and relaxed island is becoming increasingly popular, with several
                      neighbouring private islands being acquired by the Emir of Qatar and Russian
                      Oligarchs.

                      Corfu attracts the most visitors and investors out of all the Ionian Islands.
                      The historic and beautiful Venetian town of Corfu is a Unesco World Heritage
                      site, which when combined with the International Airport, the International
                      Marina and the fabled North East Coast of Corfu, makes Corfu the ideal place
                      to invest. The prime area for luxury property is the North-East Coast, with
                      its charming villages, attractive bays, exceptional swimming waters and
                      water-front tavernas. This area is ideal for boating and is regularly
                      frequented by royal families, which is testament to its beauty and uniqueness.

                    <p>
                      The island of Odysseus is an incredibly naturally beautiful island. It is the
                      second smallest and the most under-developed island in the Ionian. Life on the
                      island is unhurried and tranquil and therefore has great appeal to the
                      discerning investor.

                      Kefalonia is the largest of the Ionians and is well known for its strikingly
                      beautiful beaches. The North of the island has pretty waterside villages,
                      where the village of Fiskardo is the Ionian’s yachting equivalent to St
                      Tropez, with its wonderful harbour, brightly coloured buildings and excellent
                      tavernas attracting many of the bigger yachts. This increasingly popular
                      corner of the Ionian is becoming an appealing place to invest.

                      Zakynthos is the most southerly of the Ionian Islands, this beautiful island
                      was nicknamed 'Flower of the East' by the Venetians. The west side is
                      relatively mountainous and is largely uninhabited, while the east side has
                      picturesque bays and long sandy beaches. The Peligoni Club located in the
                      north has strong following and the area surrounding it has become a desirable
                      place to invest.

                      Paxos is a small and chic island with a great atmosphere that feels like
                      you’ve stepped back in time. As a result, it has become a desirable place to
                      invest. Gaios, the island’s capital, is pretty with well-proportioned Venetian
                      houses and a wonderful harbour, whilst Loggos and Lakka are charming seafront
                      villages buzzing with boats and tavernas. The island is densely covered in
                      olive and cypress trees and has some stunning bays and pebble beaches with
                      emerald waters perfect for swimming and boating.
