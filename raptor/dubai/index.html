                        <strong>Parks and recreation</strong>
                      </p>
                      <p>Wherever you live in Dubai, entertainment is never far from your door. The city is a thriving metropolis that caters to every desire; culture, food, fashion, sport, shopping, sunbathing – the list of what to do and see is almost endless.</p>
                      <p>Dubai sets the stage for world-class sporting events, concerts and festivals all year-round. You can visit waterparks and swim with dolphins or take advantage of its many theme parks offering whole days of family fun both indoors and outdoors. LEGOLAND and IMG World of Adventures – the world’s largest indoor theme park - are some of the renowned leisure experiences in the Emirate.</p>
                      <p>Cultural experiences are also in abundance, whether you are looking to peruse an art gallery, go to the theatre or visit some of the museums to learn about Dubai’s history.</p>
                      <p>Fashion and shopping are definitely a prime attraction. Some of the most famous fashion houses and brands call Dubai home, but if they are a little beyond your budget one of the city’s many highly skilled tailors can create you something bespoke for a fraction of the price.</p>

                        <strong>Restaurants and shopping</strong>
                      </p>
                      <p>From traditional open-air markets to vast modern shopping centres, visitors are spoiled for choice when it comes to shopping in Dubai. Whether you’re looking to update your wardrobe with designer brands or pick up a souvenir from a historical souk, Dubai has you covered.</p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>The Dubai Mall</strong>: The biggest mall in the world beat its own record in 2018 by adding an extension and getting even larger. With over 1,200 retail stores spread over an area the size of 200 football pitches, the Dubai Mall has something for everyone, from ultra-luxury outlets to high-street stores. Don’t be surprised to find there’s more than one outlet for the same brands – the mall is so vast that it might be worth hopping onto an indoor car that can take you around it. There’s a range of art to glimpse at venues like Gallery One, and a broad selection of entertainment to enjoy, including an Olympic-size ice rink, a cinema and an aquarium.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        <strong>The Gold Souk</strong>: The mesmerising Dubai Gold Souk on the banks of Dubai Creek is undoubtedly one of the most famous attractions in Dubai, with millions of visitors each year browsing the 380 stalls and stores selling every item of jewellery imaginable. As with most markets in Dubai, haggling is expected, but as Dubai has few taxes and is a major centre for the international gold trade, prices usually match the global standard. Windows filled with rows of shimmering gold necklaces, bangles and rings sit side by side with diamond merchants and expert silversmiths in the narrow alleyways. The world’s largest gold market boasts the world’s largest and heaviest gold ring in the world, weighing in at 64 kilos (141 pounds), displayed in a window at the centre of the souk.

                      <strong>Entertainment and nightlife</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Dining out is a national pastime in Dubai and with over 10,000 restaurants in the Emirate, you can guarantee there will be something to satisfy every culinary craving.</p>
                    <p>However, what makes Dubai really special is those unique experiences you won’t find anywhere else. Skydiving over The Palm, Diving in the Dubai Mall Aquarium, zip lining over Dubai Mall’s dancing fountains or simply watching the sunset from the world’s tallest building. One thing is for sure, Dubai definitely doesn’t do understated.</p>

                      <strong>Schools and education</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>Education in Dubai covers the levels of primary, secondary and collegiate education. The school system in Dubai is not different from the education system in the United Arab Emirates. There are many public and private schools catering to Emiratis and expatriates. The Ministry of Education of the United Arab Emirates is responsible for accreditation of schools.</p>
                    <p>The Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) supervises all schools, institutes, vocational institutions, adult and special needs centres, day care centres, government, and private universities in Dubai.</p>

                        <p>Bus: The bus network in Dubai is run by the Roads and Transport Authority. These buses connect all the major landmarks and tourist spots of the city, and are very comfortable. With the fare starting at Dh 2, these buses run every 15-20 minutes, except on Fridays, when the frequency is a bit low. You can also take the economical Big Bus sightseeing tour, which takes you to all the major attractions and offers live commentary and free admission to the Dubai Museum and a dhow cruise.</p>

                      <li>
                        <p>Water Bus: An economical and preferred way to travel from Bur Dubai to Deira and vice versa. Fares for the water buses range from Dh 1 – Dh 4, depending on the route you take.</p>
